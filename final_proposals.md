I would like to create a "keyboard typing bot" that can accuratly type whatever I say. For starters I must figure out how this bot is going to recieve input from my voice. I must also figure out how sensitive the sensor is for understanding the letters based on pronunciations.

I would like to create a "LightSwitcher bot" that automatically turns the lights off and on when entering and leaving my room. I must figure out what type of sensor and how powerful it must be in order to achieve an accurate motion. A simple hand bot with one finger sticking out so it can make physical contact with the switch should be enough.

I would like to create a "Piano perfomer bot" that plays a specific note (no chords) based on a persons voice (pitch). I must figure out how accuratly a sensor can detect pitch based on the input it is recieving. I must also figure out how long and short the bot presses a key for which depends on  how loud or soft the sensors are detecting the overall loudness of what it hears.
