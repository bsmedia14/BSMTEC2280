Week1: Research for creating a Robot arm. Learning the compnents and basics of what is needed
order to accomplish different motions using a servo.

Week2: Research for creating a arduino sythesizer. Learning the components and basics of what is needed
order to accomplish low fi synth.

Week3: Synth debunked. I want to create a code my self
with the knowledge that I gained in this class.

Week4: A 4 pot sequencer is the idea I will go for. Analogs: A0, A1, A2, A3 and A4 can be used as potentimeters in order to control differnent pitches, scales, and tempo.These can be accomplished by setting up Arrays.
