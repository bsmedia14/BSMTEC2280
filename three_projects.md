ARDUINO SYNTHESIZER BY: audreyobscura // http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Arduino-Synthesizer/
An interesting approach for minipulating sounds in various ways. The ability of shaping sounds/noises with a simple interface sounds 
great for people starting out in the world of synthesis. Using a tone library, this artist was able to program the arudino as an
output source to generate gnarly sounds.

ARDUINO ROBOT BY: NguyÃªn AnhN // http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Robot/
Robots in general are awesome to play around with. But whats even more awesome is designing and progamming your own robot for whatever 
use the individual creating it wants to go for. This specific artist wanted to create a robot for the specific use of the robot being 
able to play soccer. To me it sounds great because the robotic world has a competetive platform where individuals or teams create robots
for certain competitions. The use of arduino for robotics is great especially for individuals who want to start out in creating robots.

ARDUINO SMART WORKING HELMET BY:  Ardumotive_com // http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Smart-Working-Helmet/
An awesome project that is great for an actual necessity in the real world, especially for workers who risk their health in enviroments that
are not always 100 perecent safe. This artist desgined a working helmet that detects gases and tempetures with the use of sensors. The
sensors will alert if their are high levels of either gas, tempeture, or even loudness with a specific buzz and led for each category. 
This project I believe is a great approach in a marketing point of view, as this allows companies to reach out to people like this certain 
artist and give them the oppurtuniy to actually devolop this idea even further.
